  description: |
    Ansible is a radically simple IT automation platform that makes your
    applications and systems easier to deploy and maintain. Automate everything
    from code deployment to network configuration to cloud management, in a
    language that approaches plain English, using SSH, with no agents to install
    on remote systems.
